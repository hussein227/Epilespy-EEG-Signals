## Project Description
### Title 
Classification Epilespy (EEG Signals) 
Canadian Chamber Of Commerce
### Course 
BSc Thesis under Supervisor Dr.Wael Zakria
### Theme
The theme of the project, is to create a complete Online Learning System. An Online
Learning System is a web application through which individuals can attend pre-recorded
courses online. Existing web applications include but are not limited to Coursera, Udemy,
LinkedIn Learning, Great Learning and Udacity.


### Overview 
This project followed the Agile Methodology; meaning it was splited into Sprints, with
each Sprint lasting a set amount of time and a fully functioning version of the project
with the specified System Requirements should be submitted and evaluated.

### Objectives
- Learn how to properly use the Agile Methodology to plan out a project and develop
the software.
- Learn the process of following a given set of System Requirements to develop a
software.
- Learn to research and master the use of the MERN Stack.
- Learn how to work together as a team on GitHub.

## Motivation
The project is done as a group for a german university course (Advanced Computer lab) and This project is done as a simulation to real company working flow where all team members contribuite together for a final project. which motivated us to put our efforts on a project where we can learn new technologies along side with implementing them on a real application .We make an online courses website to encourage people
to develop their skills and make this process easy by learning from home. 
## Code Styles
The project is formatted using `prettier` also The project follows the  [ MVC ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)design pattern ,MVC is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user , So the Files in the backend was divided into the M (models) where the schema of the models exist which represent the core of the database , the C (controller) where the functions needed for the routes exists and the V (views) the view in MERN stack is represented by the react frontend server. Also the routes in our project was abstracted from the controller function as shown in [ API References](#api-references)

## Tools and Frameworks
Google Colab with MNE Library 

## Build Status 
 - The project currently under development and there are some styling problems to be fixed 
- jest tests to be added
